### Branch Protection Implementation Matrix

| Branch Type | Security Level | Required Checks | Reviews | Signed Commits | Admin Bypass |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| main | Maximum | All SAST + Tests | 2 + CODEOWNERS | Required | No |
| develop | High | SAST + Tests | 1 | Required | Hotfix only |
| release/* | High | SAST + Tests | 2 | Required | No |
| feature/* | Moderate | Tests only | 0-1 | Recommended | Yes |
| security/* | High | SAST + Tests | 1 (security team) | Required | No |
| hotfix/* | High | Tests + Quick SAST | 1 + Emergency approval | Required | Limited |

## üõ°Ô∏è SAST Integration Requirements

### Required Status Checks for Protected Branches

#### Security Scanning Requirements
```yaml
Required Checks:
  CodeQL Analysis:
    - "CodeQL Analysis (javascript)"
    - "CodeQL Analysis (python)"
    - Context: "CodeQL / Analyze (javascript)"
    - Context: "CodeQL / Analyze (python)"
  
  Semgrep Security:
    - "üîç Semgrep Security Scan"
    - Context: "semgrep-scan"
    - Required for: main, develop, release/*, security/*
  
  Additional Security:
    - "Secret Scanning Results"
    - "Dependency Security Check"
    - "Container Security Scan"
    - "IaC Security Validation"
```

#### Build & Test Requirements
```yaml
Required Checks:
  Core Pipeline:
    - "Build / Build and Test"
    - "Build / Lint and Format Check"  
    - "Build / Type Check"
    - "Test / Unit Tests"
    - "Test / Integration Tests"
  
  Quality Gates:
    - "Coverage / Code Coverage > 80%"
    - "Quality / SonarQube Quality Gate"
    - "Performance / Bundle Size Check"
```

## üîê Signed Commit Strategy

### Organization-Wide Signing Requirements

#### GPG Key Management
```bash
# Required setup for all developers
git config --global user.signingkey [GPG-KEY-ID]
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global tag.gpgSign true

# Alternative: SSH signing (recommended)
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

#### Commit Signing Enforcement Levels
- **main branch**: üö® REQUIRED (no exceptions)
- **develop branch**: üö® REQUIRED
- **release/* branches**: üö® REQUIRED  
- **security/* branches**: üö® REQUIRED
- **feature/* branches**: ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED
- **hotfix/* branches**: üö® REQUIRED

## üìã CODEOWNERS Configuration

### Proposed CODEOWNERS Structure
```bash
# Global ownership (fallback)
* @fanz-org/core-team

# Security-critical files
/security/ @fanz-org/security-team
/.github/ @fanz-org/security-team @fanz-org/devops-team
/scripts/security/ @fanz-org/security-team

## ‚ö° Developer Workflow Impact

### Optimized Developer Experience

#### Pre-commit Hooks Setup
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit

# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
      
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: commit-signing-check
        name: Check commit signing
        entry: scripts/check-commit-signing.sh
        language: system
```

#### Fast Security Feedback Loop
```yaml
# Lightweight security checks for rapid feedback
Quick Security Pipeline:
  triggers: [push, pull_request]
  duration: <3 minutes
  
  steps:
    - Secret scanning (gitleaks): ~30 seconds
    - Basic linting: ~45 seconds  
    - Dependency audit: ~60 seconds
    - Unit tests: ~90 seconds

Full Security Pipeline:
  triggers: [pull_request to main/develop]
  duration: <8 minutes
  
  steps:
    - All quick checks: ~3 minutes
    - CodeQL analysis: ~4 minutes
    - Semgrep SAST: ~1 minute
    - Container scanning: ~2 minutes
```

    required: number;
    enforced: boolean;
    codeowners: boolean;
  };
  signedCommitRequired: boolean;
  lastValidated: Date;
  complianceScore: number;
}

// Daily compliance check
async function validateBranchProtection(): Promise<BranchProtectionStatus[]> {
  // Implementation to check all repositories
  // Report non-compliance to FanzDash
  // Alert security team of violations
}
```
