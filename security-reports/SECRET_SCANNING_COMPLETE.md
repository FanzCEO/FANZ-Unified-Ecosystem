## 🛡️ Security Features Deployed

### 1. **Custom Adult Platform Detection Rules**
- **CCBill API Keys** - Adult payment processor credentials  
- **Paxum Tokens** - Creator payout system access
- **Segpay Credentials** - European payment processing  
- **Epoch Keys** - Alternative adult payment processor
- **FANZ Platform Tokens** - Internal API keys and JWT secrets
- **Age Verification APIs** - Compliance service credentials
- **Content Moderation Keys** - NSFW detection services
- **Adult CDN Tokens** - Specialized content delivery credentials

### 2. **Multi-Layer Protection**
- **🔍 Pre-commit Hooks** - Block secrets before they enter git
- **🤖 GitHub Actions** - Automated scanning on every push/PR
- **📊 SARIF Reporting** - Security findings integration  
- **🚨 Real-time Alerts** - Immediate notifications for critical secrets

### 3. **Adult Content Platform Considerations**
- **Payment Processor Priority** - CCBill, Paxum, Segpay flagged as CRITICAL
- **Compliance Integration** - Age verification and 2257 compliance keys
- **Content Safety** - Moderation API and NSFW detection credentials
- **Geographic Distribution** - Region-specific CDN and storage keys

## 🔍 Initial Security Scan Results

### Detected Issues (Sample from FANZ_UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM)
```
⚠️ FANZ_UNIFIED_ECOSYSTEM: Potential secrets found - detailed scan recommended

Key Findings:
- VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN detected in configuration files
- Demo tokens in documentation (non-production)  
- High-entropy secrets in package-lock.json (npm checksums - false positive)
- JWT secrets in example configurations
- Database URLs in sample configurations
```

### Critical Assessment
- **🟢 No Payment Processor Secrets** - No CCBill, Paxum, or Segpay credentials exposed
- **🟡 Configuration Cleanup Needed** - Demo tokens and examples should be sanitized  
- **🟢 NPM Dependencies Safe** - High-entropy findings are integrity checksums (expected)

## 📁 Deployed Files & Infrastructure

### Per Repository Deployment

## 🚀 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **🧹 Clean Demo Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Remove demo tokens from documentation
   grep -r "demo-token" . --exclude-dir=.git
   
   # Sanitize vault root tokens from examples  
   grep -r "VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN" . --exclude-dir=.git
   ```

2. **🔄 Secret Rotation Setup**
   ```bash
   # Set up HashiCorp Vault for production
   ./scripts/security/secret-management/rotate-secrets.sh
   
   # Configure FanzDash secret management integration
   ```

3. **👥 Team Training**
   - Review `security-reports/secret-management-guide.md`
   - Practice secure secret handling workflows
   - Understand pre-commit hook requirements

### Long-term Security Roadmap
1. **Secret Management Service** - HashiCorp Vault integration
2. **Automated Rotation** - 90-day maximum secret lifecycle  
3. **Compliance Integration** - PCI DSS for payment processors
4. **Incident Response** - Automated secret revocation procedures
