### Docker Compose Security Details
# 🐳 Docker Compose Security Scan Summary
Generated: Tue Sep 16 09:09:17 CDT 2025

## Overview
- Files Scanned: 4
- Total Passed Checks: 0
- Total Failed Checks: 0

## Common Issues Found
- Services running as root user
- Exposed ports without necessity
- Missing resource limits
- Privileged containers
- Host network usage

## Recommendations
1. Run services as non-root users
2. Implement resource limits
3. Use security_opt for enhanced security
4. Avoid privileged mode
5. Use secrets management for sensitive data
6. Implement health checks
7. Use specific image tags instead of 'latest'

## Files Scanned
