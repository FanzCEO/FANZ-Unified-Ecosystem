## 🚨 Incident Types & Response Capabilities

### Adult Platform Specific Incidents
- **💳 PAYMENT_BREACH** - CCBill, Paxum, Segpay credential exposure
- **🔞 CONTENT_VIOLATION** - Adult content compliance violations
- **🆔 AGE_VERIFICATION** - Age verification system compromise

### Severity-Based Response Times
- **🚨 CRITICAL (Level 1)** - <15 minutes: Payment breaches, data exposure
- **⚠️ HIGH (Level 2)** - <1 hour: Auth bypass, privilege escalation  
- **🟡 MEDIUM (Level 3)** - <4 hours: Content violations, suspicious activity
- **🟢 LOW (Level 4)** - <24 hours: Configuration issues, minor violations
- **ℹ️ INFO (Level 5)** - No SLA: Informational alerts, monitoring data

## 🎛️ Usage Instructions

### Manual Incident Reporting
```bash
# Report critical payment breach
./scripts/security/incident-response/incident-orchestrator.sh \
  PAYMENT_BREACH CRITICAL "CCBill credentials exposed in logs" SECURITY_TEAM

# Report content compliance issue  
./scripts/security/incident-response/incident-orchestrator.sh \
  CONTENT_VIOLATION HIGH "Age verification bypass detected" AUTOMATED_SCAN

# Report infrastructure issue
./scripts/security/incident-response/incident-orchestrator.sh \
  INFRASTRUCTURE MEDIUM "Database connection failures increasing" MONITORING
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Navigate to any FANZ repository
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. Select **"🚨 FANZ Security Incident Response"** workflow
