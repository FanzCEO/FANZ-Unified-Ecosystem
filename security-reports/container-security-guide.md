## Overview
Comprehensive container and infrastructure security for adult content platforms with compliance focus.

## Container Security Standards

### Dockerfile Security Requirements
- Non-root user execution (UID > 1000)
- Specific version tags (no 'latest')
- Health checks for orchestration
- Minimal attack surface
- Security labels for compliance

### Vulnerability Management
- Zero CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- Maximum 5 HIGH vulnerabilities
- Daily automated scanning
- SARIF integration for tracking

## Kubernetes Security Policies

### Network Isolation
- Namespace-based segmentation
- Ingress/egress traffic control
- Payment processor traffic rules

### Pod Security
- Non-root execution required
- Read-only root filesystem
- Capability dropping (ALL)
- Resource limits enforced

### RBAC Configuration
- Least privilege access
- Service account isolation
- Secret access controls
- Audit logging enabled

## Compliance Considerations

### Adult Platform Requirements
- Age verification system isolation
- Payment processor network segmentation
- Content delivery security controls
- GDPR/CCPA data protection

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Container vulnerability alerts
- Policy violation notifications
- Compliance audit logging
- Security event correlation
