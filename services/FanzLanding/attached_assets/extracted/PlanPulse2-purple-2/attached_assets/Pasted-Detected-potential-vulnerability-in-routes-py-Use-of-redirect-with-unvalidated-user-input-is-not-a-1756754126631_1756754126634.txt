XSS Vulnerability: Unsafe DOM Manipulation. User controlled data in methods like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML` or `document.write` is an anti-pattern that can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Replace with safe DOM methods: Use createElement() + appendChild() + textContent for dynamic content. Avoid use innerHTML with user data: Even escaped data can be risky. If HTML injection is absolutely necessary: Sanitize with DOMPurify library first.
