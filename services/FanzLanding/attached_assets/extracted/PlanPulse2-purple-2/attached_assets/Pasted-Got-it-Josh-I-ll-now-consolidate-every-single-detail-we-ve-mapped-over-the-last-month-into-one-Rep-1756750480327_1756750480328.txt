Got it Josh — I’ll now consolidate every single detail we’ve mapped over the last month into one Replit-ready directive. This will be your master system doc to hand off to your devs so they can spin up FanzLab 2.0 exactly as envisioned: neon-drip style, full-featured, clusterized, and compliance-driven.

⸻

⚡ SYSTEM / PROJECT DIRECTIVE — “FanzLab 2.0 Neon Portal”

🎯 Objective

Build FanzLab 2.0:
	•	The front-door landing portal for the entire Fanz ecosystem.
	•	One login → one compliance brain → multi-cluster creator economy.
	•	Styled after the neon-drip Fanz logo (glowing banana, rainbow outlines, dripping animations).
	•	Integrates compliance (2257, VerifyMy), monetization, media, AI moderation, security, and community into one connected experience.

⸻

🖼️ Non-Negotiable Theme
	•	Dark mode base with neon glow UI.
	•	Motion effects: hover glows, drip animations, neon flicker.
	•	Cluster logos = neon variants of main brand.
	•	Banana drip TM integrated into loading screens & success banners.

⸻

🔑 Core Flows
	•	Signup/Login: Single Sign-On (SSO) across ecosystem.
	•	Role selection: Fan / STAR (Creator) / Moderator / Admin / Exec.
	•	Verification pipeline: Inline VerifyMy inside your 2257 form.
	•	Platform selection: Join any cluster (BoyFanz, GirlFanz, PupFanz, TranzFanz, TabooFanz, DaddyFanz, AllMyFanz, RecoveryFanz, etc.).
	•	Cross-post toggle: one-click posting across clusters.

⸻

📑 2257 Compliance (Hosted on FanzLab)
	•	Native 2257 form with embedded VerifyMy (ID + liveness).
	•	Uploads: Gov ID, selfie, W-9/W-8BEN, address docs.
	•	Forensic e-signature: IP, device hash, timestamp, geo, PDF hash.
	•	Checkboxes: 18+, 2257 compliance, platform policies, NDA, IP assignment.
	•	STAR/STARZ contracts: NDA, non-disparagement, policies signed here.
	•	Co-star tagging: all must pass VerifyMy + sign scene-level consent.

⸻

🏛️ FanzHubVault (Central Repository)
	•	Stores all people & compliance data:
	•	Signed 2257 packets.
	•	VerifyMy result JSON + artifacts.
	•	Tax forms, contracts, signatures.
	•	Co-star attestations, audit events.
	•	Immutable, encrypted (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit).
	•	Audit trail: every change hashed, append-only.
	•	Lifecycle: doc expiry alerts, re-verification prompts.

⸻

🛡️ FanzSecurityDash (Admin & Moderation)
	•	Verification Queue (Pending / Approved / Denied / Needs Fix).
	•	Drill-down user profiles (KYC status, contracts, docs).
	•	Scene readiness widget (blocks publishing if missing verifications).
	•	Kill-switch: quarantine flagged content, freeze payouts.
	•	Export packs: subpoena/LE bundles (2257 + hashes).
	•	Alerts: expired IDs, failed VerifyMy checks, unusual activity.

⸻

🌐 Cluster & Ecosystem Connections
	•	Cluster options visible in neon grid:
	•	BoyFanz / GirlFanz / PupFanz / TranzFanz / DaddyFanz / TabooFanz / AllMyFanz / RecoveryFanz.
	•	Expansion clusters: FanzTube, FanzVarsity, FanzWork, FanzFluence, FanzVIP, FanzAI.
	•	Fans/STARZ can join multiple, manage from one dashboard.
	•	FANZVIP bundles = one membership spanning all chosen clusters.

⸻

💸 Payments & Monetization

	•	Multi-level affiliate program baked in.

	•	Admin Dashboard: approvals, moderation queue, compliance alerts.
	•	Exec Dashboard: growth KPIs, cluster performance, revenue roll-ups.

⸻

🎥 Media & AI Tools
	•	Upload hub with AI-enhanced editing (filters, blur, auto-enhance).
	•	Manual editor: cropping, watermarking, censor tools.
	•	Metadata tagging for SEO & compliance.
	•	Cross-post pipeline: publish to multiple clusters in one click.

⸻

📣 Community Modules

	•	FanzVarsity: courses, coaching, learning tools.
	•	FanzWork: freelance marketplace for creators/managers/photographers.
	•	FanzFluence: social marketing toolkit.

⸻

🔧 Developer & Infra Requirements
	•	Clusterized microservices: each platform standalone but tied via central APIs.
	•	Databases:
	•	NeonDB/Postgres for compliance & users.
	•	Object storage for media.
	•	Drizzle migrations:
	•	users, documents, verifications, consents, audit_events, scenes.
	•	API Endpoints:
	•	/kyc/verifymy/webhook
	•	/2257/submit
	•	/consents
	•	/scenes/{id}/participants
	•	/security/content/{id}/quarantine

	•	Kill-switch protocols wired into Admin Dash.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	User signs up → verifies → signs contracts → selects clusters → lands in neon dashboard.
	•	VerifyMy webhooks update status within 60s.
	•	STAR cannot publish content until all co-stars verified + signed.
	•	All signed packets stored in FanzHubVault with hash + audit event.
	•	Kill-switch freezes payouts & quarantines linked content instantly.
	•	Export pack bundles compliance docs in one click (with access log).
	•	All UI styled neon-glow (logo aesthetic across flows).

🔥 One Sentence Pitch:
FanzLab 2.0 = The neon-dripping banana gateway to the new creator economy — one login, one vault, infinite clusters.

⸻

Josh — this is the full master directive. Do you want me to expand this into a visual cluster diagram (main portal → verification → FanzHubVault → clusters → dashboards) so your devs see the architecture at a glance?
