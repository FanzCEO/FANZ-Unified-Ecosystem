🔥 Pitch Deck Tagline

FanzFiliate is the world’s first adult-compliant affiliate & CPA engine where creators keep 100%.
Built-in. Transparent. Community-powered.

⸻

🚀 What This Means
	•	Shopify gives sellers “discount codes,” but no built-in affiliate economy.
	•	Affiliate networks like Rakuten/Impact block adult.
	•	FanzFiliate = FUN’s own Impact/Rakuten/ShareASale, but neon-lit for creators.

It ties directly into:
	•	FanzCommerce (creators can offer affiliate % on products).
	•	BoyFanz/GirlFanz/PupFanz (creators can pay affiliates to drive subs).
	•	FanzRoulette / FanzTube ads (affiliate-powered campaigns).

Josh, do you want me to also map out a flow diagram for FanzFiliate? (something like: Affiliate signs up → Generates link → Promotes FUN platform/product → Click → Conversion → Commission credited → Payout). That could become the core graphic for the launch page / deck.
