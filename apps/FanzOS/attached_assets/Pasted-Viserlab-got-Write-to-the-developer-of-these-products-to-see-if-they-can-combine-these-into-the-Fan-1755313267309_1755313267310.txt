Here’s the plan:

	1.	Combine: Merge both lists into one, removing duplicate points but keeping every unique detail.
	2.	Group by function so your developers can see features logically: Branding & Structure → Users & Permissions → Core Features → Monetization → Compliance → Admin Tools → Marketing → Technical → Never-Before-Seen Innovations.
	3.	Mark Priority: I can add priority labels (P1, P2, P3) for build order.
	4.	Prep for PDF: I’ll format so it’s developer-ready and can include diagrams for:
	•	Multi-brand architecture (BoyFanz, PupFanz, GirlFanz, etc. under FUN umbrella with SSO)
	•	Fan → Creator → Admin user flow
	•	Escrow payment process
	•	VIP Visertube ecosystem integration

Yes — this will be even stronger once we merge everything:

	•	Master Requirements List
	•	ViserLab Development Requirements
	•	FUN ViserLab Integration & VIP Portal Requirements (the section you just sent)

When I merge them, I’ll:

	1.	Remove duplicates but keep every unique detail.
	2.	Organize into logical build sections so the dev team can see dependencies and priorities.
	3.	Add priority levels (P1 immediate build, P2 secondary features, P3 future expansion).
	4.	Include diagrams for:
	•	Multi-brand/SSO structure
	•	Fan → Creator → Admin flows
	•	Escrow payment process
	•	VIP/Geolocation feature ecosystem
	5.	Make it developer-ready PDF so it can be handed to ViserLab or your in-house team without extra explanation.

Got it — here’s how I’ll handle this next step so everything is one unified, developer-ready FUN Build Bible:

1. Merge All Specs into One Master Document

I’ll combine:
	•	Master Requirements List
	•	ViserLab Development Requirements
	•	FUN ViserLab Integration & VIP Portal Requirements
	•	“What’s Inside” Quick Tour & Source Grounding Highlights you just sent

2. Structure the Document for Developers

	•	Section 1 – Core Architecture & Branding (SSO, multi-tenant portals, sub-brand domains, unified homepage)
	•	Section 2 – Panels (Admin, Creator, Fan) with full feature breakdown
	•	Section 3 – Modules & Integrations (ViserTube, ForumLab, ViserLance, CollabStar, SMMLab, ViserCard, VerifyMyAge, Coconut)
	•	Section 4 – New Never-Before-Seen Features (custom requests escrow, AR previews, geo hot zones, recovery mode, etc.)
	•	Section 5 – Compliance, Safety & Security
	•	Section 6 – Tech Stack & Infrastructure
	•	Section 7 – Acceptance Criteria & Phased Rollout

3. Add Developer-Friendly Deliverables

	•	Architecture diagrams (SSO flow, VIP feed, geolocation, escrow process, media pipeline w/ Coconut)
	•	User flows (Fan → Creator → Admin)
	•	Data models (users, content, escrow, payment, affiliate, campaigns)
	•	Phased rollout roadmap (P1, P2, P3)
	•	Jira-ready CSV for epics → stories → acceptance criteria

4. Make it Fully Actionable

When complete, your dev team could literally:
	•	Import the Jira CSV and have the entire build in their backlog.
	•	Use diagrams for onboarding new developers.
	•	Follow acceptance criteria to meet your exact vision without rework.

If you say yes, I can produce:

	•	The final merged PDF Build Bible
	•	Architecture diagrams
	•	Jira import CSV

2. Monetization Rules – 100% Creator Revenue Model

	•	Creators keep 100% of subscription money — no platform fee deducted from their payouts.
	•	Platform revenue on subscriptions comes from a fixed dollar amount added on top of the fan’s subscription price.
	•	Example: Creator sets subscription at $10 → Fan pays $12 (extra $2 goes to FUN).
	•	This extra fee is adjustable site-wide in the admin panel.
	•	Platform revenue on other transactions (PPV, tips, custom content, marketplace jobs, collabs) is handled by percentage-based commissions, adjustable in the admin panel by category:
	•	Example:
	•	PPV: 5%
	•	Tips: 2%
	•	Custom Content Requests: 10%
	•	Marketplace/Collabs: 15%
	•	Escrow handling for custom requests:
	•	Fan funds request upfront → money held in platform escrow → released to creator after admin approval of delivery.
	•	Refund option if request rejected or not fulfilled.
