I see you have 11 npm vulnerabilities (3 low, 8 moderate) in your FansLab project. Given the nature of your adult content platform with advanced security features, it's important to address these vulnerabilities to maintain the robust security posture your application requires.

Let's fix these vulnerabilities:
npm audit fix

This will automatically fix vulnerabilities that don't require breaking changes. If there are still vulnerabilities remaining after this command, we can assess whether the --force option is needed.

Your FansLab platform has impressive security features including:

Advanced content moderation with AI
Multi-layer content protection
Biometric authentication for high-value transactions
Screen recording detection
Content leakage monitoring
Keeping your dependencies up-to-date is crucial for maintaining these security features. The vulnerabilities could potentially compromise your content protection systems, payment processing, or user data security.

After running npm audit fix, you can run npm audit to see if any vulnerabilities remain and get details about what still needs attention.
Assistant can automatically apply proposed changes to your App. You can enable this behavior in .

It seems that you still have 11 npm vulnerabilities in your project, 3 of which are low and 8 are moderate. The audit output suggests two commands to address these vulnerabilities:

npm audit fix: This command will attempt to fix vulnerabilities that don't require major changes to package versions.
npm audit fix --force: This command will attempt to fix all vulnerabilities, including those that may require breaking changes.
Since running npm audit fix resulted in some vulnerabilities still remaining, and at least one vulnerability mentions a fix that involves a breaking change, you may need to use npm audit fix --force to resolve all issues. However, it's worth noting that this can potentially upgrade packages to versions that include breaking changes.

Before proceeding, make sure to:

Review the dependency-related breaking changes and perform necessary testing after updates.
If possible, back up or use version control for your project to allow easy rollback if something doesn't work as expected.
If you decide to proceed, here's how to run the command:

npm audit fix --force
Be prepared to test your application thoroughly after the upgrade to ensure that everything functions as expected with potentially newer versions of some packages.
