Module    Contribution to the Ultimate FansLab
RateLab    Authentic user reviews and ratings boost trust and engagement; integrated into creator profiles or events.
ForumLab    Built-in community discussions—support threads, topic forums, Q&A—enhance creator-fan interaction.
CollabStar    Facilitates collaborations and brand partnerships within the creator ecosystem.
ViserGo    Gamified experiences and contests to engage fans; ideal for raffles, giveaways, or exclusive access.
AffiLab    Advanced affiliate marketing infrastructure for scalable referral systems and conversions tracking.

Geolocation Map & Creator Chat

One of the most powerful new envisioned features is:
    •    Geolocation Creator Map: A visual, interactive map showing nearby creator profiles, live events, competitions, or collaboration opportunities—exclusive to creators.

    •    Launch campaigns or competitions (CollabStar, ViserGo)
