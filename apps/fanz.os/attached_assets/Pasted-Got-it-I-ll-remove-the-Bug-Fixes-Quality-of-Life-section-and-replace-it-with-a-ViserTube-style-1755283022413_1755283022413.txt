Got it ✅
I’ll remove the “Bug Fixes & Quality of Life” section and replace it with a ViserTube-style video area (inspired by ViserLab.com), competitive feature absorption from FansLab, OnlyFans, and Fansly, and a Policy & Trust Framework section modeled after BoyFanz.com’s footer with DMCA and other trust-building visuals.
