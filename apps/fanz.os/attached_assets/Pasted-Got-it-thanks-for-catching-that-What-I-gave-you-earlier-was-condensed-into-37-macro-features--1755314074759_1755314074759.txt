Got it ✅ — thanks for catching that. What I gave you earlier was condensed into 37 “macro features,” but the full FUN / Fanz ecosystem actually breaks down into hundreds of micro-features when you count every toggle, integration, compliance flow, and engagement mechanic.

Let’s do this properly: a Build Bible with categories → numbered features → sub-features so nothing is missed.
