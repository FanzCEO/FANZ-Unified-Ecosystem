Awesome—let’s spec this as a turnkey feature you can hand to engineering. I’ll call it the Bulk Messaging Orchestrator.

What it does (at a glance)

Send a single campaign to Fanz, Creators, Admins, Moderators, or “Everyone”—and choose delivery channels: Email, Direct Message (DM), and/or In‑Platform Popup (any combination). Includes targeting, scheduling, personalization, throttling, compliance, and analytics.

Key requirements

Audience & Targeting
	•	Primary dropdown (required): Fanz | Creators | Admins | Moderators | Everyone
	•	Advanced filters (optional):
	•	Engagement (e.g., “active in last 30 days”, “unverified”, “paid subs only”)
	•	Geography (country/region), language
	•	Subscription status & tier, creator vertical/category
	•	Compliance state (age-verified, KYC status)
	•	Exclusions: specific users/roles, suppression lists, unsubscribed, high-complaint users.
	•	Deduplication: if “Everyone” is selected, the same account isn’t messaged twice across overlapping roles.

Channels (multi-select)
	•	Email
	•	Direct Message (internal inbox)
	•	In‑Platform Popup (modal or banner with CTA)
	•	Optional Send to all selected channels toggle.

Content & Personalization
	•	Template picker per channel + live preview.
	•	Liquid-style variables: {{display_name}}, {{role}}, {{creator_name}}, {{subscription_tier}}, {{cta_url}}, etc.
	•	Localization: auto-select template by user language; fallback to default.
	•	Attachments: email only (with size limits).
	•	A/B test (optional): subject/body variants; even split or weighted.

Scheduling & Throttling
	•	Send now or schedule (with timezone awareness).
	•	Batching & rate limits per provider (e.g., SES/Sendgrid).
	•	Safe-mode cap (e.g., max 10k/hr) + progressive ramp-up.
	•	Quiet hours policy support (e.g., no push/popup 10pm–8am local).

Compliance & Preferences
	•	Honors email opt-out, DM opt-out, popup opt-out independently.
	•	CAN‑SPAM/GDPR/CASL compliant footers + required sender identity.
	•	Age-sensitive audiences: no explicit previews in email subjects; use neutral copy.
	•	Unsubscribe & preference center links; per-channel toggles.
	•	Suppression lists (bounces, complaints, hard unsubscribes).

Approvals, Security & Audit
	•	RBAC: only Admins/Moderators with permission can send to global audiences.
	•	Two-person approval for >10k recipients or cross-role blasts.
	•	Full audit log: who created/edited/approved/sent, timestamps, diffs.
	•	Dry run to test group of 10 recipients + seed list.

Analytics & Reporting
	•	Email: sent/delivered/bounce/complaint/open/click; domain breakdown.
	•	DM: delivered/read/replied.
	•	Popup: impression/close/CTA click; device breakdown.
	•	Per-segment metrics + export CSV.
	•	Conversion tracking (e.g., “verified email” completion after reminder).

API endpoints (example)
	•	POST /api/campaigns – create campaign
	•	PUT /api/campaigns/{id} – update audience/filters
	•	POST /api/campaigns/{id}/channels – add channel config
	•	POST /api/campaigns/{id}/validate – lint templates & variables
	•	POST /api/campaigns/{id}/test-send – to seed list
	•	POST /api/campaigns/{id}/submit – request approval

	•	GET /api/campaigns/{id}/analytics – rollups + per-channel
	•	Webhooks: /webhooks/email (delivery, bounce, complaint), /webhooks/dm, /webhooks/popup

⸻

Delivery flow (high level)
	1.	Audience resolution (respecting roles, filters, exclusions, preferences).
	2.	Deduplicate recipients across roles; tag each with final channel list after preference checks.
	3.	Chunking to batches → enqueue per channel.
	4.	Send workers per channel provider:
	•	Email: SES/SendGrid/Mailgun SDK; DKIM/SPF aligned.
	•	DM: internal message service; push inbox notification.
	•	Popup: create notification entity; client fetch or WebSocket push; show once per user/session with snooze/dismiss states.
	5.	Webhooks update deliveries table; analytics aggregates roll up to campaigns.

⸻

UI details you asked for
	•	Single dropdown to pick Fanz / Creators / Admin / Moderators / Everyone.
	•	Channel toggles:
	•	Send Email
	•	Send Direct Message
	•	Show Platform Popup
	•	plus Also send to all selected channels (enables multi-channel delivery).
	•	Preview panel with tabs: Email | DM | Popup.
	•	“Remind unverified” templates you already use (2, 5, 7, 10‑day) can be re-used here as prebuilt templates.

⸻

Guardrails & edge cases
	•	Unverified emails → auto-route to DM + Popup if email bounces or is unverified.
	•	Quiet hours → queue popups until allowed window; email can still send if compliant, or delay if configured.
	•	High-risk words in subject/body (adult platform) → lint against blocklist; suggest safer copy.
	•	Rate limit spikes → auto-throttle, backoff + retry with jitter; pause campaign if bounce/complaint rate crosses threshold.
	•	Accessibility → larger default font for verification emails (you noted), ARIA labels on popups, keyboard dismiss.
	•	Privacy → no sensitive content previews in popup/DM unless user opted in.

⸻

“Never-before-done” smart add-ons (optional but powerful)
	•	Channel Mix Optimizer: for each recipient, predict best channel combo (email-only vs email+popup) using past open/read/dismiss behavior to maximize reach while minimizing annoyance.
	•	Auto-Goal Campaigns: choose an outcome (e.g., “complete email verification”) and the system sequences the right messages (email→popup→DM) until the goal is met or a limit is hit.
	•	Engagement Cooldown: if a user saw >2 platform messages today, hold popups and switch to DM or defer to next day.

⸻

Acceptance criteria (checklist)
	•	Dropdown supports roles: Fanz, Creators, Admin, Moderators, Everyone
	•	Multi-channel selection: Email, DM, Popup (any combination)
	•	Templates per channel with variables + preview
	•	Audience filters + exclusions + dedupe
	•	Schedule now/later, rate limiting, quiet hours
	•	Test send & two-person approval for large sends
	•	Per-channel analytics (deliveries, opens, reads, clicks, dismiss)
	•	Opt-out & suppression respected per channel
	•	Full audit log and exportable reports

⸻

If you want, I can convert this into:
	•	a Jira-ready epic with user stories & acceptance criteria,
	•	a DB migration script plan, and
	•	provider integration tickets (SES/Sendgrid + internal DM/Popup workers).
